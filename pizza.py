# Training algorithm spat out a "weight", which is our slope. Use predict (equation of line) to predict num pizzas for 20 reservations.
# 2.1 was the slope of the line Prof drew, visually, himself. Estimation, not final, just for testing. Pretending we trained the model.

# Today's machine learning algorithm does not scale once we have too many variables (weights, which are slope).
# Becomes an NP problem (too big to solve) ->theoretical comp. sci. topic! <3

# Iterative approach: guess, try, improve.
# LOSS: Distance between points and points on the line, aiming to minimize the loss.
# When the weight is zero, starting at the X axis.

# Calculating the error: Guess weight, test with our labeled training data, error is the difference between y and y_hat.
# We don't want positives and negatives, so (rather than abs. value) we will SQUARE the data (makes it stronger + normalizes data).
# Our loss function will be the average of all of these (guess a weight W, plug in X values to test, etc)
# So add all numbers together, divide by inputs, gets us the MEAN ERROR. Ex, guessing "2". 49, 144, 16 then div by 3.
# Want to find a LOSS function to determine MEAN SQUARED ERROR for our guess.
# Average of SQUARED differences (Y and Y_hat) is our MEAN SQUARED ERROR.
